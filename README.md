School project for the subject __Programiranje 1__. 
I will analyze the first 24 pages (~1000 samples) of best-selling audiobooks in English on the [Audible](https://www.audible.com/search) website.

## Data

For each audiobook I will cover:
* title
* audiobook id
* release date
* length
* summary
* author and narrator
* price
* ratings
* categories

I am going to get the title, audiobook id, release date, length, price, summary, author and narrator for each book from the search. This data is stored in audiobooks.csv file. Furthermore, I will also cover specific ratings and categories of each audiobook. This is done by visiting the actual audiobook webpage.

## Hypotheses

1) Price depends on release date
  
  <sup>I assume newer books have a higher price-to-length ratio.</sup>

2) There is a correlation between rating and category

  <sup>For example, self improvement audiobooks could have on average higher scores than romance audibooks.</sup>

3) Can we predict the price of the audiobook?
