School project for the subject __Programiranje 1__. 
It is an analysis of data obtained from the [Audible](https://www.audible.com/search) website.

1) price depends on release date
  
  I assume that the newer books have a higher price-to-length ratio

2) audiobooks from the __Personal Success__ category get highest ratings
